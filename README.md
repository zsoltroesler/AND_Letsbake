**Project #3: Baking app**
Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

In this project you will:
- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android with UI testing.
- Add a widget to your app experience to display the corresponding recipe ingredients
- Leverage a third-party library in your app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world.
You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
